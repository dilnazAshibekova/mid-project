                 <div>All over the world, ecotourism is becoming more and more popular near specially protected natural areas such as national parks and reserves. This is because untouched oases are preserved there, and even if people are allowed any kind of recreation activity, it is quite strictly regulated.

                    Of course, there are much more places than just these twenty, which we will note in this article. This list will only help those who are traveling for the first time across the country. That is why we would like to list only the brightest pearls of our natural treasures that are located throughout several regions, combining those that are not far from each other into one.

                <div>
                    Both northern and southern species of animals such as deer, elk, roe deer, etc, can be found here. In the forests, foxes, wolves and hares are often seen running about. And even if it’s not as often, you definitely will see them at some point! Also there are granite rocks of beautifully bizarre forms, as if they were carved by someone out of giant slabs to resemble these shapes. Almost everyone knows about its legend and their names. It is not surprising that this region has long been loved by both locals and foreign travelers, and a perfect new road directly from Nur-Sultan (Astana) provides easy access to there. It's just a 2 hour drive, a bit over 250 km, and you are there!

                <div>
               </div>
               Kolsay Lakes are located in the territory of the Kolsay Kolderi National Park, at a height of 1818, 2252 and 2850 meters above sea level. Kaindy Lake is located 12 km east of Kolsay Lakes and stretches out for 400 meters in length. You can visit the two lower Kolsay Lakes and Kaindy Lake in one weekend trip. Upper Kolsay (the third lake) is located about 4 km further from the second one and 600 m higher, and it requires a lot longer walk and better physique of the climber to accomplish this tedious trek. Kolsay is a great place for hiking, horse riding and mountain biking. Kaindy Lake appeared about a hundred years ago as a result of the collapse of a huge mass of rock that blocked the gorge by placing a natural dam. Dry fir trunks rise above the water surface like men on guard. The lake is surrounded by rocky slopes and steep cliffs on all sides, and you can only drive up to the water from one side.

                <div>
               </div>
               Charyn Canyon is one of the most interesting things about the nature encompassing the Almaty Province. The canyon is composed of sedimentary rocks, which can be dated back to about 12 million years! 
               At sunset the walls of the canyon, made from large deposits of clay become red and shimmer with remarkably beautiful hues. The so-called “Castles Valley” is the most visited place by tourists. 
               Charyn Canyon resembles The Grand Canyon in Texas, Colorado, in North America. Although it is inferior in size, the beauty of the “Castles Valley” is enchanting and unique. It will also be interesting to visit the Temirlik Canyon, 
               where a grove of relic ash is preserved, as well as Uzunbulak Canyon (also known as Moon Canyon) and Kurtogay Canyon.
